Where to view this piece: on this page.

I majored in maths and computational science at university, where I studied some algorithmics and data visualisation. I was able to combine my interests in maths, data visualisation and Wikipedia in this &ldquo;Mathematicians of Wikipedia&rdquo; project. The inspiration for this visualisation came from a few things I had going on at the time:

I was implementing graph algorithms in Python, and wanted some data that I could try visualising their output on.
I wanted to try some basic web programming, using HTML and Vega Lite graphics library (as an alternative to the ggplot2 library that I usually used).
I was interested in the history of mathematics, and was reading a randomly selected mathematician&rsquo;s Wikipedia page each day.

This piece is a few years old now, so I wouldn&rsquo;t say it reflects my current skills and abilities, but I&rsquo;m still proud of the passion that I put into it.">
