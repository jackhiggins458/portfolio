<meta name="description" content="In pursuit of (im)balanced Catan boards
Where to view this piece: [INSERT HERE]

Recently, I was playing Catan with some friends, and we began to wonder: how could determine how &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; a particular Catan board is?

Curiosity got the better of me, and before I knew it I had a whole project planned out. This is very much a work in progress, but so far I&rsquo;ve been working on:

Writing a Python library for working with hexagonal grids.
Writing another Python library for visualising the game state of Catan (which I used to generate the image above).
Developing an index, composed of multiple measures, to put a number on how &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; a particular board is.
Generating a synthetic population of millions of randomly generated boards to apply my index to, and to hopefully find some truly &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; (and some horribly &ldquo;imbalanced&rdquo;) boards.

When I get the time, I&rsquo;ll also be looking to complete a write up on Catan board balance, what it means, how I&rsquo;ve measured it, and what I&rsquo;ve found.">
