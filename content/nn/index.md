At the ABS, I was an active member of the Machine Learning (ML) Community of Practice, a group open to all staff interested in learning about ML. At the time, there was an increase in the use of ML methods within the organisation. Consequently, there was a large influx of staff joining the community of practice, many of whom didn't have much experience with ML. To help upskill new community members, three colleagues and I organised a series of introductory ML talks and tutorials. 

While my colleagues worked on talks, I wanted facilitate a more interactive learning experience. To do so, I created a series of tutorials in a Jupyter Lab environment, to introduce attendees to:

- Navigating computational notebook environments.
- Programming fundamentals in the R.
- Implementing and testing a very basic neural network.



These tutorials were:

- Designed to be approachable for staff with limited background in programming and machine learning, whilst also containing enough depth to engage more experienced members.
- Sequenced to follow after my colleagues' more theoretical talks, progressively building up to a rewarding capstone task â€” implementing a neural network in R.
- Written in Markdown and R code using Jupyter Lab.
- Intended to be followed interactively on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) in a group setting, with the support of a more experienced facilitator.
- Updated multiple times after seeking feedback from participants.



I facilitated these tutorials once in 2021 and again in 2022, and received a significant amount of positive (as well as constructive) feedback from participants about their experience.

[^1]: Unfortunately, Binder sometimes takes a long while to launch (and occasionally fails to launch at all). If you're having trouble launching the interactive Binder, try viewing the tutorial [on GitHub instead](https://github.com/jackhiggins458/Neural_Network_Tutorial/blob/main/notebooks/0_Welcome.ipynb). Please note however that the GitHub preview of the notebooks aren't interactive, and they have a few issues rendering the content accurately.
