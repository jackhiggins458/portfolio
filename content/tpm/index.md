I wrote this essay for an assignment submission in my final semester of my maths undergraduate degree. At the time, I was interested in learning more about graph theory and different types of proofs. I decided to write a short piece explaining the probabilistic method, a non-constructive proof method used occasionally in combinatorics and graph theory.

In this piece, I aimed to provide an engaging, first year level introduction to:

- The probabilistic method, and non-constructive proofs more broadly. 
- Graphs, hypergraphs and (hyper)graph colouring.
- An example of the probabilistic method in action in a hypergraph colouring proof.
