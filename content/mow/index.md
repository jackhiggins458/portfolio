I majored in maths and computational science at university, where I studied some algorithmics and data visualisation. I was able to combine my interests in maths, data visualisation and Wikipedia in this "Mathematicians of Wikipedia" project. The inspiration for this visualisation came from a few things I had going on at the time:

- I was implementing graph algorithms in Python, and wanted some data that I could try visualising their output on.
- I wanted to try some basic web programming, using HTML and [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) graphics library (as an alternative to the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) library that I usually used).
- I was interested in the history of mathematics, and was reading a randomly selected mathematician's Wikipedia page each day.

This piece is a few years old now, so I wouldn't say it reflects my current skills and abilities, but I'm still proud of the passion that I put into it.
