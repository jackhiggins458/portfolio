## Hi there 👋😄

You've stumbled upon my portfolio. Welcome! 

I'm Jack (he/they). I am an early career data professional, with particular interests in:

- Developing reproducible data analyses. 
- Communicating technical ideas in fun and engaging ways.
- Learning new things, especially if it involves maths or plants!

Here are a few personal and professional pieces that I'm proud of:

🛠️ [Building reproducible data pipelines]( {{< relref "pipelines/index.md" >}})

🔢 [An introduction to neural networks]( {{< relref "nn/index.md" >}} )

🌾 [In pursuit of (im)balanced Catan boards]( {{< relref "catan/index.md" >}} )

🛸 [The proof is in the ~~pudding~~ probability]( {{< relref "tpm/index.md" >}} )

👩‍🏫 [Mathematicians of Wikipedia]( {{< relref "mow/index.md" >}} )
